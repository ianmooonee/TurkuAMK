# Configuring the input pin to have internal pull-up resistor 

The GPIO-pins of raspi have a few important properties: 

- Direction – is it input or output? 
- Bias – if it is an input, does it have pull-up or pull-down resistor, or neither.

In case the I/O-pins direction is output, you can set the value and properties of that pin with gpioset.  
In case of input, use gpioget to read its value and configure its properties 

```
pi@JarnoRaspi1:~ $ gpioget -h 
Usage: gpioget [OPTIONS] <chip name/number> <offset 1> <offset 2> ... 

Read line value(s) from a GPIO chip 
  
Options: 
  -h, --help: display this message and exit 
  -v, --version: display the version and exit 
  -l, --active-low: set the line active state to low 
  -B, --bias=[as-is|disable|pull-down|pull-up] (defaults to 'as-is'): 
set the line bias 
 
Biases: 
  as-is: leave bias unchanged 
  disable: disable bias 
  pull-up: enable pull-up 
  pull-down: enable pull-down 
```
 
Now, if you want to have a button input, the most common (and best way) way is to connect a button between a GPIO-pin and ground, and provide a pull-up resistor. When the button is unpressed, the pull-up resistor "pull" the input high = to vcc = logical '1'. When the button is pressed, it connects the gpio-pin to ground = logical '0'.

Now, to make our circuit easier, we can use the built-in pull-up resistor of raspberry pi GPIO cell. 

For example, setting pull-up resistor for pin 22: 
```
pi@JarnoRaspi1:~ $ gpioget --bias=pull-up gpiochip0 22 
```
 
Now we can get rid of the external 3k3 resistor, plus we don't have to route 3.3V Vcc to the breadboard. 
How to do this in your program? 

Well, there might be a function in gpiod-library for that, but at least I couldn't find it. So let's use a work-around: 

You can use system()-function 
```
system("gpioget --bias=pull-up gpiochip0 22"); 
```
 
Place this after you have configured the line as an input ( with gpiod_chip_get_line() -function call ) 
 
**Note: **It seems that the functionality of the pull-up -resistor has some issues on some Raspberry Pi's. Before this  has been solved, use external pull-up resistor for button input.
