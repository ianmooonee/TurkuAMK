Generally, for each lab exercise, you are supposed to:

1. Create the schematics and calculate / write down the required component values and expected voltages/currents as stated in the lab instruction.
2. Simulate your design with LTSpice and write down the simulation results. Compare those with calculated values.
3. Measure your design and compare the values with calculated and simulation values.

When submitting lab notebooks/reports, use the file format, which is viewable with web browser in git. These include: PDF, plain text, .md markup. 

MS Office or Open Office documents (.doc, .docx, .odt, .odf) cannot be rendered by web browsers, which makes them pretty slow to read through, as they need to be downlaoded first.
